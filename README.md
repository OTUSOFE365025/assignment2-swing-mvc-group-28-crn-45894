# Answers to questions 1 and 2:

1) *Do some investigation into the Swing framework and write a short paragraph describing the purpose of the Swing framework. Submit a class diagram of the components of Swing.*

Swing is Java's GUI toolkit, similar to JavaFX and others. It is an older framework and used to create different components like buttons, labels, containers and panels. The main componnet is JContainer, and almost every component extends off of it. It allows you to change appearance during runtime as well as has the MVC model to seperate data from view. Overall, while quite outdated, Swing remains a solid choice for most developers looking to create Java applications.

2) *Look through the example code in the GitHub repository and explain how this example implements the MVC pattern. How does it differ from the conventional MVC pattern described in the lectures?*
